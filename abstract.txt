"The pbdR Project: Distributed Computing with R,"
Section on Statistical Computing, JSM2018, Vancouver, BC, Canada. (Invited). 

Duration: 20 mins

Abstract:

In this talk, we will introduce the project of Programming with Big Data
in R (pbdR) at http://r-pbd.org/.
The pbdR project is aiming for large scale computing platforms, in particular,
bring R and statistics to super computer architectures where by default
using distributed processors and memory to deal large scale computation and
large amount of data from simulated or observed.
A prototype of pbdR was stated around late 2011 mainly developed under
message passing interface (MPI) environment with R.
Later in 2012, the pbdR focused on large scale distributed
computation environment built upon several scalable numerical libraries
enlarge R's capability on high performance computing.
Subsequently, several statistical applications had been implemented
and tested on large datasets in Tera bytes scale.
Beside easy-to-use programming capability, we brought user interaction
interface into the pbdR started in late 2015.
By utilizing a high-performance asynchronous messaging library (ZeroMQ),
we continuously establish the pbdR's interacition feature on larger scale
environment.
Future considerations will conclude this talk.
