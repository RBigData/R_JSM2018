Chen, W.-C., Schmidt, D., and Ostrouchov, G. (2018)
"The pbdR Project: Distributed Computing with R,"
Section on Statistical Computing, JSM2018, Vancouver, BC, Canada. (Invited). 

Duration: 20 mins

Abstract:

In this talk, we will introduce the project of Programming with Big Data
in R (pbdR).
A prototype was stated around late 2011 mainly developed under
message passing interface (MPI) environment with R.
Later in 2012, the pbdR focused on large scale distributed
computation environment built upon several scalable numerical libraries
enlarge R's capability on high performance computing.
Beside easy-to-use programming capability, we brought user interaction
interface into the pbdR started in late 2015.
We continuously to enhance the pbdR's interacition feature to larger scale
environment.
Future considerations will conclude this talk.
