"The pbdR Project: Distributed Computing with R,"
Section on Statistical Computing, JSM2018, Vancouver, BC, Canada. (Invited). 

Duration: 20 mins

Abstract:

In this talk, we will introduce the project of Programming with Big Data
in R (pbdR) available at http://r-pbd.org/ and CRAN.
The pbdR project is suitable from small to large scale computing platforms
including regular laptops, multicore computers, and multi-node clusters.
In particular, the pbdR project is aiming for bringing R and statistics
to supercomputer architectures where by default
using distributed processors and memory to deal with large scale computation and
data analysis for simulation or observational studies.
A prototype of pbdR was stated around late 2011 mainly developed under
message passing interface (MPI) environment with R.
Later in 2012, the pbdR focused on large scale distributed
computation environment built upon scalable libraries (ScaLAPACK)
enlarging R's capability on high performance computing systems.
Subsequently, several statistical applications had been implemented
and performed on datasets of Tera bytes scale in distributed computing manner.
Beside easy-to-use programming capability, we brought native R user
interface into the pbdR started in late 2015.
By utilizing a high-performance asynchronous messaging library (ZeroMQ),
we continuously establish the pbdR's interaction feature on larger scale
environment.
Future considerations will conclude this talk.
