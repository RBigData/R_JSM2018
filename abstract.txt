We introduce the Programming with Big Data in R (pbdR)
project composed of several packages available at
http://pbdr.org/ and on CRAN. The packages provide a broad
parallel computing capability that spans multicore laptops through
multi-node clusters to supercomputers. Our philosophy is to
learn from the high performance computing
and provide native R interfaces. The
pbdR aims to bring R and statistical computing to supercomputer
architectures where a combination of shared memory, distributed
memory, and co-processor hardware is available.

The pbdR was initially developed for
the message passing interface (MPI) environment. Later,
it focused on using scalable numerical libraries (ScaLAPACK)
enlarging R's capability on high performance computing systems.
Subsequently, several statistical applications had been implemented
and applied to treascale datasets.
In addition to batch programming, we recently
developed a client-server interface capable of interactive
programming on distributed systems. By utilizing a
asynchronous messaging library (ZeroMQ), interactive
control of a distributed set of R sessions, cooperating in a
single program multiple data (SPMD) fashion is possible.
