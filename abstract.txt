"The pbdR Project: Distributed Computing with R,"
Section on Statistical Computing, JSM2018, Vancouver, BC, Canada. (Invited). 

Duration: 20 mins

Abstract:

In this talk, we will introduce the project of Programming with Big Data
in R (pbdR) available at http://r-pbd.org/ and CRAN.
The pbdR is suitable broad computing platforms scaled from small to large
including regular laptops, multicore computers, and multi-node clusters.
In particular, the pbdR is aiming for bringing R and statistics
to supercomputer architectures where by default
using distributed processors and memory to deal with very large scale
computation and data analysis for simulation or observational studies.
A prototype of pbdR was started around late 2011 mainly developed under
message passing interface (MPI) environment.
Later in 2012, the pbdR focused on distributed
computation environment built upon scalable numerical libraries (ScaLAPACK)
enlarging R's capability on high performance computing systems.
Subsequently, several statistical applications had been implemented
and performed on datasets of Tera bytes scale in distributed computing manner.
Beside easy-to-use programming capability, we brought native R user
interface into the pbdR started in late 2015.
By utilizing a high-performance asynchronous messaging library (ZeroMQ),
we continuously establish the pbdR's interaction feature and data
visualization across different computation architectures.
Future considerations will conclude this talk.
