Section on Statistical Computing, JSM2018, Vancouver, BC, Canada. (Invited). 

Duration: 20 mins

Abstract:

In this talk, we will introduce the project of Programming with Big Data
in R (pbdR) available at http://r-pbd.org/ and CRAN.
The pbdR runs in major operating systems and is suitable for
broad computing platforms from small to large scales
including regular laptops, multicore computers, and multi-node clusters.
In particular, the pbdR is aiming for bringing R and statistics
to supercomputers which are designed by default
using distributed processors and memory to deal with very large scale
computation and data analysis for simulation or observational studies.
To take advanges of different computation architectures,
a prototype of pbdR was started around late 2011 and mainly developed under
message passing interface (MPI) environment in a single program
multiple data (SPMD) style.
Later in 2012, the pbdR focused on distributed
computation environment built upon scalable numerical libraries (ScaLAPACK)
enlarging R's capability on high performance computing systems.
Subsequently, several statistical applications had been implemented
in distributed computing manners and analyses had been performed on
datasets of Tera bytes scale.
Beside the easy-to-use programming capability, we recently brought the native R
user interface into the pbdR by utilizing a high-performance asynchronous
messaging library (ZeroMQ) in a client-server style.
We continuously advance the pbdR's interaction feature and data
visualization across different computation architectures.
Future considerations will conclude this talk.
